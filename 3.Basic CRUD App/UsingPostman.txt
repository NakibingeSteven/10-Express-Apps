In Postman, you can easily make a POST request to your server's /tasks endpoint to create a new task. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Open Postman: 
If you don't have Postman installed, you can download and install it from https://www.postman.com/.

Create a New Request:
Open Postman.
Click on the "New" button to create a new request.

Set up the Request:
Choose the HTTP method as POST.
Enter the URL of your server, including the /tasks endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:3000/tasks).

Add Request Body:
In the request builder, go to the "Body" tab.
Select the raw option.
Choose the JSON (application/json) option from the dropdown.
Enter the JSON data for your new task. For example:
Copy code
{
  "description": "Your new task description here"
}


Send the Request:
Click the "Send" button to send the POST request to your server.
View the Response:

You will see the response from your server in the lower part of the Postman window. It should include the details of the newly created task, such as its ID.
